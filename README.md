# ORM-Practice E-Commerce Backend APP

## Description
A simple to use e-commerce backend that utilizes Node.js to help with creating tables.

## Credits
Some of the code I used is from another project. I used this repo as an example: https://github.com/elizabetholsavsky/e-commerce-back-end. I also used the mini project found in the UTSA gitlab Module 13 Mini-Project: Travel Planner to help as well.

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company<br />
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies<br />
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Acceptance Criteria
